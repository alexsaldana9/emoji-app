Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router
```
For this project, I used axios to make the request to json.
